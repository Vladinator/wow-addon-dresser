Dresser
==================
A simple addon that expands the default dressing room with additional buttons:
- Undress (Removes gear from current target.)
- Target (Changes the dressing room model to your target. Also works on creatures.)
- Target gear (Equips your current target gear on your current dressing room model.)
You can try out someone elses gear, or check out how someone else would look in yours.
